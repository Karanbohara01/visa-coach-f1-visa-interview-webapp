1. Metaphor Use (especially through notification)
A metaphor in UI/UX uses familiar concepts to help users understand new features.
Example:

A bell icon for notifications is a metaphor for a real-life bell that signals attention.
In React, you might use a toast notification (like react-toastify) to show messages, using a metaphorical "pop-up" to alert users.
2. Flat Design (e.g., landing page with all info and direct navigation)
Flat design avoids 3D effects, shadows, and gradients, focusing on simplicity and usability.
Example:

A React landing page with clear sections (About, Features, Contact) all visible at once, using simple colors and icons.
Navigation buttons or links let users jump directly to any section without extra clicks or searching.
3. Golden Path (e.g., three tab concept of Apple)
The "golden path" is the ideal, streamlined user journey through your app.
Example:

Apple’s three-tab interface (e.g., Music, Podcasts, Search) guides users to main features quickly.
In React, you might use a tab component (like Material-UI Tabs) to highlight the most important workflows, reducing distractions.
4. Crow’s Feet (product performance depends on user mood)
This refers to how user experience can vary based on their mood or context.
Example:

If a user is frustrated, even small delays or unclear messages can make them abandon your React app.
To address this, you might add friendly error messages, loading spinners, or helpful tooltips to keep users engaged regardless of their mood.
